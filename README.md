Unleashing the Data Wizard: Predicting House Prices

Did you know that data can predict the value of your dream home? I did, after my internship at Oasis Infobyte. I dove headfirst into a thrilling project to build a linear regression model that can accurately forecast house prices.

It was a rollercoaster of data cleaning, feature engineering, and model tuning. I transformed raw data into valuable insights, discovering hidden patterns that influence property values. The result? A model that not only predicts prices but also reveals the secret sauce behind real estate market trends.

Imagine the power of predicting housing market fluctuations! This project equipped me with the skills to turn complex data into actionable knowledge. I can't wait to apply these insights to future challenges and make a real impact.
